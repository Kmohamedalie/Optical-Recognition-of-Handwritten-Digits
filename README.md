<h3>What's OCR by Medium:</h3>
Handwritten digit recognition is an ability of machines to recognize human written digits or numbers. OCR[Optical Character Recognition] is one of the examples of handwritten text recognition. It is quite difficult for machines to understand or recognize human written text or numbers. The solution for this problem is programs like OCR or handwritten digit recognition programs. These programs takes image as input and converts them into machine understandable bits. And with the help of these bits, the computer recognizes the digits present in the image.
